# Manchester United Website - First CSS Website as part of futureproof
## Brief
Choose a sports team and create a website for that team

- Create a table that showcases facts and stats about the players eg. age, name, height
- Create a header and footer with semantic elements to frame your page
- Put your table inside a section using semantic elements
- Create another section with an image and link to the team
- Deploy the site and link to it from your portfolio

## Team Discussion
Diren and I discussed our favourite sports team and decided to do Manchester United, not because it was our favourite but because it was one of the few I knew. 
Arsenal was a no-go apparently, which was the only other one I knew.
Diren offered to research and make the table for the most famous players section, and I took charge of the CSS.

## Styling
I decided to emulate the original Manchester United website and took colours directly from its navigation bar, as well as the logo.

## Reflections
This was our first project as part of futureproof and also our first day. We learnt how to make the logo bigger on hover and it was our first time pair coding.
